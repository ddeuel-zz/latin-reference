#  README
This project is meant to be compiled through Xcode. It would be cool if the app was on the app store, but Apple charges you to get it there. My project is compatible with all iPhone and iPad devices after being compiled. Download Xcode on any MacOS device from the appstore:

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12

Then open the "Latin Reference.xcodeproj" file inside of the "Latin Reference" folder with Xcode.

There is not really any configuration to be done with this file, it should simply be run as is.

This project can be run on any of the Xcode device simulators, but I would reccomend plugging in your iPhone or iPad and selecting it at the top of the dropdown menu next to the stop button. Once selected simply hit the play button with your device unlocked and the app will appear on your home screen with a black and white "LR" icon. Click on the app; the app requires a few seconds to load the dictionary when first loaded. Enter a word, either in Latin or English to the appropriate box. Hit search on the keypad, and if there is a match for your entry, the appropriate match will appear beneath the text fields. Given are the various relevant aspects of the Latin word. Any of the four principle parts of a Latin word may be entered. If I may suggest using "veritas" our school motto for Latin and "truthfulness" our school motto translated to English, you may use those valid search queries or any other valid word. The results text is only changed when relevant, so if you misspell a word or input a word that doesn't exist in the dictionary, the results page will not change.

Fun fact: "veritas" is pronounced with a "whu" sound for the "v" so it sounds like "whereitas" when spoken.
